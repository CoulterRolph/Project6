                                                        - Sidebar.css was implemented to provide styles for the sidebar navigation.<br>
                                                        - Font-size was changed in this file as well to provide an easier reading experience.<br>

                                                        - Calibrating the oscilloscope to receive messages on the can bus proved to be challenging as the oscilloscope was having a tough time triggering on the message.<br>
                                                        - More information on how the oscilloscope was calibrated can be found under project experience/issues.

                                                        - Created functions that access the database to set and get values that are needed.<br>
                                                        - This allowed for ease of use when integrating the state machine as function were used instead of calling the same database multiple times<br>
                                                        - Above and Below Functions were also added to for the statemachine that are called and check if there are requests above the currentfloor or below<br>
                                                        - Sabbath mode was created by putting the state machine in a loop<br>

                                                        - Data is received over serial and interprets the command to move to the certain floor.<br>

                                                        - A new file was added to receive the AI messages and coresponding diagnostics and statics. <br>
